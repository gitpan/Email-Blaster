DESCRIPTION
    Email::Blaster is the latest in a long, long line of mass-emailer
    systems I have written since 2002.

    This version has many features.

    *   Testing mode.

        Send a few messages to yourself before you turn on the firehose.

    *   Domain-based throttling with hourly limits.

        Never get blacklisted again because of email flooding.

    *   Configurable (and subclassable) behaviors and components.

        If configuration alone doesn't get you what you want, you can always
        subclass something (i.e. MailSender or MaillogWatcher) to get the
        desired behavior.

    *   Scales Out Well.

        Designed to spread the work out across many, many, many servers. If
        your email list has 1Million subscribers, you could *reliably* send
        your messages to them in a matter of minutes.

        Add more servers, get more capacity and throughput.

    *   Event handlers (in serial).

        Handle server-level events with a simple plugin. Events like server
        startup and shutdown, the start or end of a transmission, etc.

        More details to follow.
